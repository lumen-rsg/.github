# 🌊 How to Contribute to Lumen
*Join us in building software that "just works" — and maybe cure boredom along the way.*

## 🎯 First Time? No Problem! 
Whether you’re here to code, document, or brainstorm:  
1. **Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lumen-rsg/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. 
2. **Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FontaineRSG/lumina/issues)** for tasks labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.  
3. **Ask questions** in [Discussions]()(will create a space for it later).

## 🛠️ Ways to Contribute 

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs 
1. **Search first** — someone might’ve already reported it.  
2. **Open an Issue** with:  
   - A clear title (e.g., `[Bug] Cursor vanishes when installing on VM`).  
   - Steps to reproduce (pretend we’ve never touched a keyboard).  
   - Screenshots/logs if possible.  

### 💡 Suggesting Features 
1. **Check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/lumen-rsg/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)** .  
2. **Open an Issue** with:  
   - The `enhancement` label.  
   - A clear "Why?" (e.g., *"Let users customize the dock because defaults are boring"*).  

### 👩💻 Writing Code 
1. **Fork the repo**.  
2. **Branch out**: Use descriptive names like `feature/dock-animations` or `fix/typo-readme`.  
3. **Test your code** (yes, even if you’re bored).  
4. **Document changes** in PR descriptions (we love context).  

### 📖 Improving Docs 
Spotted a typo? Confusing instructions? Docs are code too!  
- Fix grammar, add examples, or explain things better.

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

-   **Code**: Follow existing patterns (even if they’re weird).
    
-   **Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat: add dock animation`).
    
-   **PRs**: Keep them small and focused. Giant PRs = 😴.

## ❓ Need Help?

-   **Ask in Discussions**: No shame in not knowing.
